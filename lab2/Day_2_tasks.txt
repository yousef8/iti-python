1-
    Define a class named Shape with attributes name and _color (private).
    Implement encapsulation by providing methods get_color() and set_color(color).
    Include an abstract method calculate_area() in the Shape class.
    Create two subclasses, Circle and Square, each inheriting from Shape.
    Implement polymorphism by overriding the calculate_area() method in the subclasses.
    Create another subclass, Rectangle, inheriting from Shape with additional attributes such as length and width.
    print the calculate_area for Circle, Square and Rectangle "assume length = width = 5 as inputs"

2-  Create a Python function that reads a file containing student names and their grades,
    calculates the average grade, and identifies students who have failed.

3-  given this list : numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36],  Calculate square root of each number using lambda and map 
    and create dictionary contains numbers and sqrt_of_numbers and write it to json file.
